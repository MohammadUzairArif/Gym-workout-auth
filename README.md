 🏋️‍♂️ WorkoutBuddy

📄 Project Description

WorkoutBuddy is a full-stack fitness web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) combined with Tailwind CSS for responsive styling. The app offers user authentication with sign-up and login functionality, allowing users to securely manage their personal workout routines.

Once signed in, users land on a clean and intuitive dashboard where they can create, update, and delete their own workouts — including specifying workout title, load, reps, and sets. The app leverages Axios for seamless API communication, React Router DOM for smooth navigation, and CORS for secure cross-origin requests.

This project demonstrates a real-world use case of authentication, protected routes, stateful CRUD operations, and dynamic UI updates — ideal for fitness enthusiasts who want to track and customize their training plans.
